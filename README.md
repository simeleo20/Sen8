# Sen8

A NES and pico8 inspired fantasy console.

The interface is similar to that of pico8 but as for architecture it is more similar to the first Nintendo in fact it is not possible to draw on the screen directly, you have to load the tiles and then you can map the bg or set up to 64 sprites on the screen.
